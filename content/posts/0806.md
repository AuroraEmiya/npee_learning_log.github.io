## 操作系统-three easy pieces

### Memory API

1. `void * malloc(size_t size)`

2. `void free(void* ptr)`

### Common Errors

1. Forgetting To Allocate Memory
2. Not Allocating Enough Memory
3. Forgetting To Initializing Memory
4. Forgetting To Free Memory
5. Freeing Memory Before You Are Done With It
6. Freeing Memory Repeatedly
7. Calling `free()` Incorrectly

### Other Call 

1. `calloc()`
2. `realloc()`



### Address Translation

1. hardware-based address translation: Base and bound
